### Daily Logic
Parents with two children - a son and a daughter - came to a wide river. There was no bridge there. The only way to get to the other side was to ask a fisherman if he could lend them his boat. However, the boat could carry only one adult or two children.
How does the family get to the other side and return the boat to the fisherman?

### Daily Logic
Another river crossing puzzle goes as follows. Three humans, one big monkey and two small monkeys are to cross a river:

Only humans and the big monkey can row the boat.
At all times, the number of humans on either side of the river must be greater or equal to the number of monkeys on that side. (Or else the humans will be eaten by the monkeys!)
The boat only has room for 2 (monkeys or humans).
Monkeys can jump out of the boat when it's banked.

### We're having some problems with `gh-pages` branches, so please branch all branches off of `master` and delete `gh-pages`

1. Do: `git checkout master`
2. `git pull origin master` - This will grab all of your most recent code from GitHub and update your master branch on your laptop
3. `git branch -D gh-pages` - This permanently deletes the `gh-pages` branch
4. Make ALL additional branches for anything else we do in this class off of the `master` branch.
  a. **Every time you want to start a new branch:** `git checkout master`, `git pull origin master`, `git checkout -b new-branch`

### Eric's Git / GitHub presentation

### Responsive Hero Page

Follow the curriculum:

* Bring a piece of paper and pencil to class and begin drawing out the layout of boxes you see for your mobile design.
* Repeat for the tablet view.
* Make new branches
* Code it.
* add, commit, push, pr and copy/paste link to turn in.

## TUESDAY - 29

### PRESENTATION: Ryan Delong

#### THURSDAY PRESENTATION: Joe Hauger

### Daily Logic

A teacher says: I'm thinking of two natural numbers greater than 1. Try to guess what they are.
The first student knows their product and the other one knows their sum.
First: I do not know the sum.
Second: I knew that. The sum is less than 14.
First: I knew that. However, now I know the numbers.
Second: And so do I.
What were the numbers?

**Grading**: You need to get at least a 70% to continue with the course. Checkpoints are weighted higher than assignments. If you put **any** link into Campus Manager **before the due date**, you'll earn at least 50 points out of 100. If that link contains the correct information for the assignment, you'll earn 100 points total. If the link does not contain the information the assignment asks for, you will maintain 50 points.  If you update that link at a later date with the correct information, I will award you 25 points for a total of 75. If there is no link and it is past the due date, you will get 0 points.

### CSS Grid

0. Go to your ACA folder in Terminal.
1. Make sure you have a `src` folder. `cd` into it. Open VS Code.
2. Go to your origin branch (`master` or `gh-pages`) do `git pull` and then create a `dashboard` branch off of it.
3. In VS Code, create a `dashboard.html` page. Create a `dashboard-style.css` file.
4. In order to link your `dashboard.html` into your `portfolio.html`, create an `<a href="dashboard.html"></a>` within `portfolio.html`
