### Daily Logic
Parents with two children - a son and a daughter - came to a wide river. There was no bridge there. The only way to get to the other side was to ask a fisherman if he could lend them his boat. However, the boat could carry only one adult or two children.
How does the family get to the other side and return the boat to the fisherman?

### Daily Logic
Another river crossing puzzle goes as follows. Three humans, one big monkey and two small monkeys are to cross a river:

Only humans and the big monkey can row the boat.
At all times, the number of humans on either side of the river must be greater or equal to the number of monkeys on that side. (Or else the humans will be eaten by the monkeys!)
The boat only has room for 2 (monkeys or humans).
Monkeys can jump out of the boat when it's banked.

### We're having some problems with `gh-pages` branches, so please branch all branches off of `master` and delete `gh-pages`

1. Do: `git checkout master`
2. `git pull origin master` - This will grab all of your most recent code from GitHub and update your master branch on your laptop
3. `git branch -D gh-pages` - This permanently deletes the `gh-pages` branch
4. Make ALL additional branches for anything else we do in this class off of the `master` branch.
  a. **Every time you want to start a new branch:** `git checkout master`, `git pull origin master`, `git checkout -b new-branch`

### Eric's Git / GitHub presentation
